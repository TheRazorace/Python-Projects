# Data Mining Project

Mail classification (real or spam) using data mining and artificial intelligence techniques. Techniques include creating a K-Nearset-Neighbors model, creating a Random Forest Classifier model, as well as word embeddings with the implementation of a Doc2Vec model supported by a neural network.
