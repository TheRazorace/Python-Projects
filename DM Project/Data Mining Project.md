# Data Mining Project

Mail classification (real or spam) and patient classification (possible stroke or not) using data mining and artificial intelligence techniques. Techniques include creating a K-Nearset-Neighbors model, creating a Random Forest Classifier model, as well as word embeddings with the implementation of a Doc2Vec model supported by a neural network. Project was implemented using Python 3.7.
